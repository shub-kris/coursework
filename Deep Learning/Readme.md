# Introduction to Deep Neural Networks - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the Introduction to Deep Neural Networks course (Winter 2019).

Solutions have been implemented using Tensorflow and Numpy.


### Linear Regression:
In this task I implement a Linear Regression Model that is trained using Gradient Descent in order to classify images from the MNIST dataset. Everything is implemented from scratch using numpy.



### Logistic Regression:
In this task I  build a logistic regression model to predict whether a high school student
will get admitted into a university based on the results on two exams. Everything is implemented from scratch using numpy.

### Multi-layer Perceptron:
In this task, I implement a multi-layer perceptron classifying the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow

### DeepNN API:
In this task, I implement the different non-linearities (ReLULayer, DenseLayer and SoftMaxLayer) and the sequential layer of Keras/Tensorflow using numpy.

### Backpropagation:
In this task, I implement the backpropagation algorithm for training a 1-hidden layer network efficiently using numpy.

### CIFAR10:
In this task, I implement a Deep Covolutional Network to predict the correct labels of images from CIFAR10 dataset. It was hosted on Kaggle as a competition between the students who took the course.

### Deep Learning Framework:
In this task, I built a small deeplearning framework just like of PyTorch/TensorFlow. Different operations like Backward Proapagation, assigning gradients with respect to operations like Addition, Subtraction, ReLu, Sigmoid and others for a base calss Tensor has been implemented.
