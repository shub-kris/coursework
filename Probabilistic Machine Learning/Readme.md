# Probabilistic Machine Learning-Assignments


This repository contains solutions for the assignments of the Course Probabilistic Machine Learning (Summer 2020).

Solutions have been implemented in Python.


### Assignment 1: 
Deep Learning for Time Series Analysis (Extrapolating the keeling Curve)


### Assignment 2:
Autonomous agent that can play the pen-and-paper game Battleships using Probability


### Assignment 3:
Autonomous agent that can play the pen-and-paper game Battleships using Monte Carlo techniques

### Assignment 4:
Probabilistic Modelling of COVID-19 Mortality

### Assignment 5:
Probabilistic SIR Model(Probabilistic Modelling of COVID-19 Infections) using Pyro 

### Assignment 6:
Gausian Process Regression

### Assignment 7:
Gaussian Process binary classification from Scratch

### Assignment 8:
Bayesian Deep Learning
Train a DNN with SGD (or Adam), then construct a Laplace approximation to the weights, using the Hessian of the entire loss function. Sample a set of weights from this approximate posterior and, for a set of test points, plot the corresponding predictive probabilities for the two classes.

### Assignment 9:
Approximate Gaussian Process Regression on time series involving count data using Laplace Bridge

### Assignment 10:
Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) with Gibbs Sampling 

### Assignment 11:
Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) with Mean Field Variational Inference

### Assignment 12:
Kernel Topic Modelling
